      "0.6.2": [
        "An issue was fixed that would cause DepCtrl initializer code in modules previously loaded with regular Lua loading mechanisms to be skipped when requested in a _DependencyControl_- context. This kept the [requireffi](https://github.com/torque/ffi-experiments/tree/master/requireffi) _DependencyControl_ record from being established, preventing any updates from taking place.",
        "UnitTestSuite: Fixed several broken assertions and related error messages, among them the `assertMatches` and `assertErrorMatches` assertions always returning `true`. Please make sure to rerun your tests after upgrading to confirm your tested actually return values whatever they were supposed to match.",
        "Updater: Identical or duplicate feeds from different sources (user configuration, feeds and API use) are no longer being checked for updates multiple times.",
        "Updater / FileOps: Fixed several broken error messages and return values."
      ],
      "0.6.1": [
        "The Updater component now supports the DownloadManager v0.4.0 API changes.",
        "Updater: A regression introduced in v0.6.0 was fixed that caused update or installation processes to fail when the feed contained deletion records.",
        "FileOps.mkdir() no longer falsely retuns an error state when a path to an existing file is passed with the `isFile` flag set."
      ],
      "0.6.0": [
        "The UnitTestSuite framework for automatically testing automation scripts and modules has been added.",
        "Macros can now be registered with custom submenu name.",
        "Logger:logEx() now takes an additional optional `indent` parameter to specify a custom indentation level.",
        "FileOps.move() no longer overwrites existing files by default.",
        "FileOps.mkdir() can now take paths relative to the current working directory as input and returns `true` on success, `false` when the directory already exists or `nil` if the operation failed.",
        "FileOps.remove() now returns detailed results for every path specified in addition to overall success information.",
        "FileOps.move() no longer fails to move files across file systems on *nix operating systems and properly cleans up after itself if files could not be overwritten and were renamed instead.",

      ],
      "0.5.3": [
        "ConfigHandler: A host of longstanding issues related to config file corruption and concurrent access to config files from multiple DepCtrl-hosting automation scripts have been fixed.",

        "A bug was fixed that could cause DepCtrl to rerun the __depCtrlInit method on modules even though a prior DependencyControl record had already been initialized.",

        "DependencyControl initialization functions in modules with optional DepCtrl support are now expected to use the predefined name __depCtrlInit. This lifts the unreasonable requirement of having to specify the name of the function in the dependency tables of the loading scripts. By extension, this also fixes errors when trying to update the binary modules required by DependencyControl (such as DownloadManager).",
        "The Updater now checks for an active internet connection before going ahead with downloading feeds and packages.",

        "The \\getConfigHandler() method no longer ignores the defaults parameter.",
        "Fixed a FileOps bug that would cause path validation to fail on paths relative to the working directory.",
        "ConfigHandler: writes to the configuration table are no longer accidentally routed to the defaults table when a value is updated that only exists in the Defaults.",
        "ConfigHandler: Looping over the configuration table is now completely transparent wrt which fields are user configuration or defaults.",
