        "Added support for purging invisible contours from drawings and clips.",
        "ASSWipe can now only be run when a video is loaded.",

      "0.3.3": [
        "The blending order check introduced for the 'Combine consecutive identical lines' feature in 0.3.2 now considers merge operations that have already taken place in the current line's blending groups, which considerably improves the number of mergeable lines in some cases."

        "The user can now cancel ASSWipe at pretty much any point in time when cleaning is in progress.",

        "Configuration for the 'quirks mode' added in ASSFoundation v0.4.0 is now exposed to the user, letting them tailor the cleaning process to either libass or vsfitlter.",
        "After cleaning contours of a drawing, a dedicated hash check is performed to ensure the process didn't visually change the lines. When it detects the change, it automatically reverts to the original contours and resumes the cleaning process. The amount of affected contours is reported in the final report.",
        "Added an option to ignore hash changes caused by contour cleaning. This may visually affect drawings, so don't use this unsupervised!",
        "Logging/error reporting was improved and logs are no written to a log file."

      "0.5.0": [
        "The 'Merge consecutive tag sections' feature now skips sections that contain any tag from a customizable exception list. Defaults to karaoke tags to avoid breaking poorly written karaoke templater scripts."
